"I can hear the worried tone from their words."

mister "Betsy? Oh Gods and Goddesses, are you ok?"

betsy "...Moo...Was I asleep? What happened?"

"There was a worried look across their faces."

missy "Betsy, you weren’t responsive when we asked you for your favourite ice cream."

missy "You simply didn’t budge at all. Then you flopped over to the floor and we had to make sure you weren’t hurt."

"I hugged both Mister and Missy."

"Perhaps what I saw was a dream. Or maybe it happened for real."

"I’m not sure if I’m ready for what will happen next."
