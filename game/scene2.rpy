"Wednesday morning, it was filled with sunshine and gentle winds from the sky. "

"Mister and Missy made plans on going out to pick up some groceries."

"Our favorite store is 15 minutes away by car and I couldn’t be way more excited to be with them."

"I was craving a dairy free version of birthday cake flavour. It’s so yummy!"

"But Mister and Missy told me not to eat too much or I’ll get sick."

"We hopped in the car and Missy drove me and Mister to our favorite store."

"The traffic wasn’t bad. I was listening to my favorite music when Missy spoke while waiting at the stoplight."

missy "Hey Betsy, still working on your painting piece with the Tower card on it? I bet it’s gonna look sweet."

betsy "Mooo...That’s if someone buys the painting off from our little shop. It’s hard being an artist sometimes."

"Missy laughed a bit."

missy "Aww, cheer up Betsy! Someone will recognise your work. You’ll see!"

"I smiled at Missy’s reassuring words."

"After a few minutes have passed, we arrived at our favourite store."

"Missy placed me in a shopping cart."

"Although, I’m pretty sure by now we’ve been given weird looks as to why seemingly normal human beings are carrying a plush animal into a grocery store."

"Sometimes, Mister has to remind the others who are looking that it’s Missy’s comfort plush animal pet after dealing with the loss of her beloved childhood pet cat. Then they understand and walk away."

"We took a stroll around the store, eying on the fruits, vegetables, snacks and other goodies."

"I was eagerly waiting for the ice cream section. Because I can’t talk out in public, I can only use my mitten hands to point which items I want in the cart."

"When we got to the ice cream section, I was looking for the birthday cake flavour when I heard a whisper."

"{i} Do they know who you really are? {/i}"

"Suddenly my field of vision turned dark. I can hear something laughing."

"Something like...my own laugh? That’s impossible. This one sounded more...evil."

"A figure stands in the middle of the aisle."

"The store now looks like it’s coming from a horror film."

"I looked around - Mister and Missy isn’t there!"

"Oh, moo...this isn’t good..."
