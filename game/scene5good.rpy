    betsy "Your tactics won’t scare me."

    evilbetsy "So then, you’ll finally tell the truth? You’re still a coward."

    betsy "I may be a coward, but I’m a cow that knows what’s right and what’s wrong."

    evilbetsy "That doesn’t make sense on what you said."

    betsy "Your existence doesn’t make sense."

    betsy "Off you go! It’s time for you to leave."

    betsy "Mister and Missy deserves to know the truth. And I know they’ll love me even after this."

    "With one final shout, I raised my paint brush in the air and palette while chanting the following spell."

    "MAIDEN MOTHER AND CRONE, BANISH THIS ILLUSION OF MYSELF FROM MY OWN HOME."
    "AND NO HARM SHALL IT BE DONE, SO MOTE IT BE."
    "BY THE POWER OF THREE, BLESSED BE!"

    "Evil Betsy started to fade away, along with the ember glow from the craft room."

    "I blinked once more and noticed the room was back to normal."

    "It’s as if nothing happened. No ember glow. No house being burnt down. Just me and my Tower painting."

    "I took a moment to settle in the newfound silence around me."

    "Evil Betsy won’t come back."

    "At least for a while."

    "I looked at the painting once more and sighed. Perhaps this was the message from the tarot card."

    "Things needed shaking up. And today was no exception."

    "I went downstairs to see Mister and Missy still cooking together."

    "No harm in sight. They were lovingly paired together while making dinner."

    "I smiled and felt a flutter in my belly. It was time for them to know the truth about me."

    betsy "Mister? Missy?"

    missy "Oh goodness! Betsy are you ok?!?"

    betsy "I am. But I wanted to tell you something that has bothered me all day."

    "They stopped cooking, with a concerned look on their face."

    mister "Aww Betsy, it’s ok. We’re here to listen. What’s on your mind?"

    betsy "I...did something really bad a long time ago."

    "Missy walked over to me and gently hugged me."

    missy "Betsy, whatever it was, don’t feel afraid. Let it out, sweetie."

    "I started to cry a bit. Then I continued."

    betsy "Missy, I really did a bad thing!"

    betsy "In order for me to be in the mall, I had to push the other stuffies away towards the back of the truck so that way the mean owner can take me first on display."

    "I kept sobbing even as I continued."

    betsy "I was picked on and said that I was a smelly cow. That I didn’t deserve to be here."

    betsy "And so I fought back. I didn’t mean to hurt the other stuffies."

    betsy "When I saw the mean owner dumping them on the street, I blamed myself for hurting them."

    betsy "Even though they were the ones that bullied me in the first place."

    "There was an awkward silence between us for a while before Mister spoke."

    mister "Betsy, what happened in the past doesn’t define you now. You did what you had to do in order to survive."

    missy "We always knew you were a special cow. From the moment I held you in my arms, I knew that you would be my lifelong familiar."

    "Mister then came over to me and gave me a hug as well."

    mister "You are here with us now. You’re a good cow. And we know that because I’ve seen you trying your best to help out with home chores. So don’t ever think that you’re a bad cow. Ok?"

    "I cried, hearing Mister’s reassuring words. Missy took a tissue and wiped my beady eyes."

    missy "With all of this talk about the past, you must be hungry. Want some cream of carrot soup?"

    betsy "Yes, please! I could go for a warm bowl right about now, moo."

    "I’m so glad to have my Mister and Missy. They mean the world to me. And I hope that we’ll always be like this, forever."
