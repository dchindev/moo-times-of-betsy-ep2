    betsynoside "It’s as if nothing happened. No ember glow. No house being burnt down. Just me and my Tower painting."

    betsynoside "I took a moment to settle in the newfound silence around me."

    betsynoside "Evil Betsy won’t come back."

    betsynoside "At least for a while."

    betsynoside "I looked at the painting once more and sighed. Perhaps this was the message from the tarot card."

    betsynoside "Things needed shaking up. And today was no exception."

    mister "Aww Betsy, it’s ok. We’re here to listen. What’s on your mind?"

    betsy sad "I...did something really bad a long time ago."

    betsynoside "Missy walked over to me and gently hugged me."

    missy "Betsy, whatever it was, don’t feel afraid. Let it out, sweetie."

    betsynoside "I started to cry a bit. Then I continued."

    betsy sad "In order for me to be in the mall, I had to push the other stuffies away towards the back of the truck so that way the mean owner can take me first on display."

    betsynoside "I kept sobbing even as I continued."

    betsy sad "I was picked on and said that I was a smelly cow. That I didn’t deserve to be here."

    betsy sad "And so I fought back. I didn’t mean to hurt the other stuffies."

    betsy sad "When I saw the mean owner dumping them on the street, I blamed myself for hurting them."

    betsy sad "Even though they were the ones that bullied me in the first place."

    betsynoside "There was an awkward silence between us for a while."

    betsynoside "Finally, Mister came over and gave me a hug as well."

    mister "Betsy, what happened in the past doesn’t define you now. You did what you had to do in order to survive."

    missy "We always knew you were a special cow. From the moment I held you in my arms, I knew that you would be my lifelong familiar."

    mister "You are here with us now. You’re a good cow."

    mister "And we know that because I’ve seen you trying your best to help out with home chores."

    mister "So don’t ever think that you’re a bad cow. Ok?"

    betsynoside "I cried, hearing Mister’s reassuring words. Missy took a tissue and wiped my beady eyes."

    missy "With all of this talk about the past, you must be hungry. Want some cream of carrot soup?"

    betsynoside "Yes, please! I could go for a warm bowl right about now, moo."

    betsynoside "I’m so glad to have my Mister and Missy. They mean the world to me. And I hope that we’ll always be like this, forever."
