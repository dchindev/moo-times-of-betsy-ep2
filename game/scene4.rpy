    betsynoside "﻿We were able to finish our grocery shopping and head home."

    betsynoside "Most of the time during the ride, we stayed silent."

    betsynoside "Hearing the slight rustle of the paper bags as Missy drove back in a normal speed with every bump on the road, it made the ride back home less awkward."

    betsynoside "I don’t ever recall ever blacking out."

    betsynoside "Only time I did was when I was super tired from playing The Sims 4 that I fell asleep on the keyboard."

    betsynoside "Poor Mister and Missy had to tuck me to bed."

    betsynoside "Mister and Missy..."

    betsynoside "What will happen to them?"

    betsynoside "As I looked at the car window, I saw Mama Luna shining brightly on the night sky."

    betsynoside "Her rays of light warmed me up. I said a prayer to Mama Luna in hopes that she’ll guide me to the right path."

    betsynoside "That maybe what I saw earlier on today wasn’t real...but perhaps a dream."

    betsynoside "After the engine was shut, Mister and Missy proceeded to take the bags out of the car."

    betsy sad "Moo...but Mister, I want to help you and Missy."

    betsynoside "Mister chuckled."

    mister "It’s okay to take some rest. You don’t need to help us out with the bags."

    mister "Why don’t you go inside and have some ice cream? Missy and I will pack away the food and will let you know when dinner is ready."

    mister "I’m making your favourite - cream of carrot soup!"

    betsynoside "I felt so happy when Mister told me that he’ll be cooking my favourite dish."

    betsy happy "Ok mister! I’ll go inside, moo."

    betsynoside "We went inside to settle ourselves in."

    betsynoside "The living room was cozy and my favourite TV show was on."

    betsynoside "I was able to grab some ice cream from the kitchen and proceeded to go sit on the couch and watch the show."

    betsynoside "I guess there was nothing to worry about after today’s event."

    betsynoside "Maybe it was my anxiety happening from the artwork I did."

    betsynoside "I worked so hard on making the Tower card painting."

    betsynoside "I remember doing an art magic ritual where I shuffled the tarot cards and immediately, the Tower card flew out of my mitten hand."

    betsynoside "I don’t know if this was a joke from the Universe to make a scary painting. But...I decided to go with it."

    betsynoside "After I ate my ice cream, I decided to go to the craft room where the Tower painting was placed on the easel."

    betsynoside "There were a few paintbrushes hanging on the table and some color paint residue on the palette."

    betsynoside "I stared at the Tower painting as I sat down in front of it."

    betsynoside "Looking at the lonely paintbrush on the floor, I picked it up and reluctantly started to finish painting on the canvas with the color palette nearby."

    betsynoside "The more I started to paint, the more I felt a sense of uneasiness settling into my plushy stomach."

    betsynoside "I took a step back just to see the canvas."

    betsynoside "The only thing that was missing were the thunderbolts and people falling off from the Tower, just as it’s shown on the actual card."

    betsynoside "Suddenly, I felt the room growing warmer than usual. Was the heat turned on my accident by Mister? The weather said it would be mild in the evening."

    betsynoside "I held my mitten hands on my head as I felt a dizzy sensation taken over me."

    betsynoside "I blinked and the entire room felt like a volcano, waiting to erupt."

    betsynoside "There was an orange fiery glow that casted all over the room."

    betsynoside "If I didn’t know any better, I would say that the place might be set on fire."

    evilbetsy "Oh but I can. So long as you’re clutching to that fear of your past, you won’t see the daylight happening once I consume your soul."

    evilbetsy "You knew what you bargained for when you were selected to be part of the mall venue."

    betsynoside "I panicked for a bit as the thought of the house being consumed by fire, along with Mister and Missy in it made me sick to my stomach."

    betsynoside "Why would she do this?"

    betsynoside "This is unfair on what you’re doing. Mister and Missy doesn’t deserve this!"

    evilbetsy "You’ll need to make a choice quickly. Speak the truth or forever hold your peace."

    betsynoside "What should I do?"
